# Easy Scalable Production ETL

*We show a lightweight scalable data pipeline that runs large Python jobs on a schedule on the cloud.*

| Data | Cost |
|------|------|
| 575 million records / day | $10/day |

It's common to run regular large-scale Python jobs on the cloud as part of production data pipelines. Modern workflow orchestration systems like Prefect, Dagster, Airflow, Argo, etc. all work well for running jobs on a regular cadence, but we often see groups struggle with complexity around cloud infrastructure and lack of scalability.

Here we show a scalable data pipeline that runs regular jobs on the cloud with [Coiled](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/index.html) and Prefect. The pipeline consists of a few Python files in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/coiled/etl-tpch) which you can [run yourself](https://github.com/coiled/etl-tpch?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-run) either locally or on the cloud. This approach is:

- **Easy to deploy** on the cloud
- **Scalable** across many cloud machines
- **Cheap to run** on ephemeral VMs and a small always-on VM

**Use Python**

Defining tasks and cloud hardware in Python makes it easy for Python data developers to write and deploy their processing code quickly.

```python
import coiled
from prefect import task, flow
import pandas as pd

@task
@coiled.function(region="us-east-2", memory="64 GiB")  # <--- Define hardware in script
def json_to_parquet(filename):
    df = pd.read_json(filename)                        # <--- Use simple pandas functions
    df.to_parquet(OUTDIR / filename.with_suffix(".parquet").name)

@flow
def convert_all_files():
    files = list_files()
    json_to_parquet.map(files)                         # <--- Map across many files at once
```

**Run jobs regularly**

Prefect runs Python jobs on a regular cadence. Coiled deploys Prefect on a cheap, always-on `t3.medium` instance (~$1/day) on AWS.

```python
from datetime import timedelta
from prefect import serve

preprocess = json_to_parquet.to_deployment(
    name="preprocess",
    interval=timedelta(minutes=15),             # <--- Run job on a regular schedule
)
reduce = query_reduce.to_deployment(
    name="reduce",
    interval=timedelta(hours=24),               # <--- Different jobs at different schedules
)

...

serve(data, preprocess, reduce, ...)
```

**Scale with Dask**

Coiled creates on-demand Dask clusters for processing larger-than-memory datasets. This lets you scale out when you need to and only pay for hardware while you're using it.

```python
import coiled
from prefect import task, flow
import dask.dataframe as dd

@task
def unshipped_orders_by_revenue(bucket):
    with coiled.Cluster(
        n_workers=200,                  # <--- Ask for hundreds of workers
        region="us-west-2",             # <--- Run anywhere on any hardware
    ) as cluster:
        with cluster.get_client() as client:
            df = dd.read_parquet(bucket)
            result = ...   # Complex query
            result.to_parquet(...)
```

## Data pipelines

*How do I process large-scale data continuously in production?*

While details will vary across use cases, data pipelines typically look something like:

- Step 1: **Acquire raw data** from the real world
  - Example: A customer buys a loaf of bread at your grocery store
  - Example: A satellite measurements sea temperature in Antarctica

- Step 2: **Regularly process** that raw data
  - Example: Apply data quality cuts followed by a feature engineering step
  - Example: Convert to a different storage format
  - Extra requirement: Retry on failures, run close to data in the cloud, alert me if processing fails

- Step 3: **Scalably analyze** that data periodically
  - Example: Large-scale query of your data that addresses a business question
  - Example: Train an ML model for weather forecasting
  - Extra requirement: Data is too large to fit on a single machine

- Step 4: **Publish results**
  - Example: Serve an interactive dashboard with a real-time view of customer orders
  - Example: Host an ML model

Running these steps on a regular cadence, task retries, and alerts are all handled well by modern workflow management systems like Prefect, Dagster, Airflow, Argo, etc. Managing cloud infrastructure and scalability is where most people tend to struggle.

## Pain points of common data pipelines

*Pipelines can be overly complex or lack scalability.*

Workflow management systems tend to struggle with:

- **Complexity** around managing cloud infrastructure:
  - Provisioning / deprovisioning cloud machines
  - Software environment management
  - Handling cloud data access
  - Cost monitoring and spending limits

- **Scale** limitations:
  - Scaling existing Python code across many cloud machines in parallel
  - Computing on larger-than-memory datasets (e.g. 100 TB Parquet dataset in S3)

Because of these issues, it's common for systems to be overly complex or expensive. Below we show an example that connects Prefect and Coiled to run a lightweight, scalable data pipeline on the cloud.

## Easy deployment for data pipelines

*Coiled and Prefect make it easy to run regularly scheduled jobs on the cloud at scale.*

Coiled is a lightweight tool that makes deploying and scaling data pipelines on the cloud straightforward. This [example data pipeline](https://github.com/coiled/etl-tpch) combines Coiled and Prefect to run regularly scheduled jobs on the cloud. It looks like this:

- Step 1: **Data generation** – New [TPC-H](https://www.tpc.org/tpch/) JSON files with customer orders and supplier information appear in an S3 bucket (every 15 minutes)

- Step 2: **Regular processing**
  - JSON gets transformed into Parquet / Delta (every 15 minutes)
  - Data compaction of small Parquet files into larger ones for efficient downstream usage (every 6 hours)

- Step 3: **Scalable analysis** – Run large-scale multi-table analysis query to monitor unshipped, high-revenue orders (every 24 hours)

- Step 4: **Serve dashboard** – Results from latest business query are served on a dashboard (always on)

This pipeline processes ~575 million records daily and costs ~$10/day to run on the cloud. Let's look at how Coiled and Prefect work together to this work.

### Define tasks and hardware in Python

Data-intensive [Prefect tasks](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/tasks) are common for per-file preprocessing steps, like those in [`pipeline/preprocess.py`](https://github.com/coiled/etl-tpch/blob/main/pipeline/preprocess.py). We combine them with [Coiled Functions](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/functions.html) for remote execution on cloud VMs. Defining tasks and cloud hardware in Python makes it easy for Python data developers to write and deploy their code quickly.

```python
# pipeline/preprocess.py

import coiled
from prefect import task, flow
import pandas as pd

@task
@coiled.function(
    region="us-east-2",       # <-- Define hardware in script
    memory="64 GiB",
)
def json_to_parquet(filename):
    df = pd.read_json(filename)     # <-- Use simple pandas functions
    df.to_parquet(OUTDIR / filename.with_suffix(".parquet").name)

@flow
def convert_all_files():
    files = list_files()
    json_to_parquet.map(files)     # <-- Run across many files at once
```

### Run jobs regularly

Related tasks are connected in a [Prefect flow](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/flows/) which defines their dependency to each other. This flow can then be scheduled to run regularly at different cadences, see for example in [`workflow.py`](https://github.com/coiled/etl-tpch/blob/main/workflow.py). We deploy this workflow on a cheap, always-on `t3.medium` instance (~$1/day) using Coiled's [`coiled prefect serve` CLI](https://docs.coiled.io/user_guide/prefect.html).

```python
# workflow.py

from datetime import timedelta
from prefect import serve

preprocess = json_to_parquet.to_deployment(
    name="preprocess",
    interval=timedelta(minutes=15),      # <--- Run job on a regular schedule
)
reduce = query_reduce.to_deployment(
    name="reduce",
    interval=timedelta(hours=24),         # <--- Different jobs at different schedules
)

...

serve(data, preprocess, reduce, ...)
```

### Scale with Dask clusters

The large-scale, multi-table analysis query in [`pipeline/reduce.py`](https://github.com/coiled/etl-tpch/blob/main/pipeline/reduce.py) uses Coiled to create an on-demand [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) cluster to handle processing our larger-than-memory data. Once the query is done all the VMs in the cluster are automatically shut down.

```python
# pipeline/reduce.py

import coiled
from prefect import task, flow
import dask.dataframe as dd

@task
def unshipped_orders_by_revenue(bucket):
    with coiled.Cluster(
        n_workers=200,                    # <--- Ask for hundreds of workers
        region="us-west-2",               # <--- Run anywhere on any hardware
    ) as cluster, cluster.get_client() as client:
        df = dd.read_parquet(bucket)
        result = ...   # Complex query
        result.to_parquet(...)
```

## Summary

Data pipelines with regular large-scale Python jobs are common, but can be difficult to deploy on the cloud or don't scale well. We showed how to:

- **Use Python** for defining tasks and cloud hardware
- **Run jobs regularly** on the cloud using Prefect and `coiled prefect serve`
- **Scale with Dask** when processing large volumes of data

in a [scalable example data pipeline](https://github.com/coiled/etl-tpch) that processes ~575 million records daily and costs ~$10/day to run on the cloud.

## Next steps

You can run this example data pipeline yourself, either locally or on the cloud.

To run things locally, make sure you have a [Prefect cloud](https://www.prefect.io/cloud) account and have authenticated your local machine. Then clone the pipeline GitHub repo, install dependencies, and run the pipeline:

```bash
# Run data pipeline locally
git clone https://github.com/coiled/etl-tpch
cd etl-tpch
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate etl-tpch
python workflow.py
```

To run the same pipeline on the cloud, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/coiled/etl-tpch?tab=readme-ov-file#cloud). Running the pipeline for several days fits comfortably within the Coiled free tier. We hope this example is easy to copy and modify for your needs.
